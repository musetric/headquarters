# Test devices

General know-how for running pages, measurements and builds on test devices.
Which devices are available is a fact of the environment at hand; find it out
for each task, as [practices/resources.md](../practices/resources.md) says.

## Every device

- **Record the environment of every result**: the device, the system, the
  browser or WebView and its version, the GPU, and the temperature. Each of
  them changes the result, and a result without them cannot be compared or
  repeated.
- **Leave nothing behind after a run**: close the pages it opened and remove
  the port mappings it made. A page left open from an interrupted run can
  wake up later and report into the next run's server.
- **Heat changes timings.** Phones and fanless machines slow down as they
  warm; a timing run notes the temperature before and after, and old and new
  variants alternate within one session.

## Android phones

- A phone attached over USB opens pages served by the computer through
  `adb reverse`, so a page on the phone reaches the computer's server as
  `localhost`.
- Keep the screen on and the phone unlocked during a run. A locked or
  sleeping phone hides the page, which then stops sending its results; to cool
  a phone, leave it idle with the screen on.
- Vendors' own system apps can come to the front over the browser and pause
  the page; check that the page is in front and visible before a series.

## Apple devices

- An iPhone or an iPad is inspected over USB with Web Inspector, from a Mac
  or through a WebKit debug proxy. Only a debug build of the app lets its
  WebView be inspected.
- Memory is the limit to watch: measure the process's footprint next to its
  kill limit, and give each heavy measurement a fresh page process.

## Desktop

- On a laptop with two GPUs, check which one the browser engine actually
  uses before a measurement.
- Several WebViews of one app that share a data folder must start with the
  same browser arguments, or the later ones fail to start.
